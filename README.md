<h1>Nessus vulnerability management</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This project consists of utilizing the open source tool Tenable Nessus to conduct a vulnerability scan. I utilized Nessus Essentials to perform a "Normal Basic Scan"and "Credential Scan" on a Windows 8.1 system, which is already vulnerable due to the lack of updates from Microsoft
<br />


<h2>Utilities Used</h2>
- <b>Tenable Nessus</b> 

<h2>Environments Used </h2>

- <b>Windows 8.1</b>
- <b>Kali Linux Virtual Machine (VM)</b>
